<p style="font-size: 30px"><i><b>Employee & Self-employed</b></i></p>
<p class="P">An employee work for someone and don't have risk of running a business. But they need to feel secure in their work and need to see it in writing. They need to reduce their fear for 'secure' by the presence of some degree of certainty. So they seek security and strong agreements when it comes to employement.<br>The idea of security is more important than money. Employees can be presidents of companies or janitors. It's not so much what they do, but the contractual agreement they have with the person or organization that hires them. <br>
Self employers run their own work. They don't like to depend on other people for their income. If they work hard, they expect to get paid for their work well. They also have understood that if they don't work hard, then they don't desire to be paid much. So they have fiercely independent souls.

  <h1 style="font-size: 60px;">The B </h1>

  <p style="font-size: 30px"><i><b>Business owner</b></i></p>
  <p class="P">This group of people could almost be the opposite of the S. 
Those who are true B’s like to surround themselves with smart 
people from all four categories: E, S, B, and I. Unlike the S, 
who doesn’t like to delegate work (because no one can do it 
better), the B likes to delegate. The true motto of a B is, “Why 
do it yourself when you can hire someone to do it for you, and 
they can do it better?”<br>Henry Ford fit this mold. As one popular story goes, a group 
of so-called intellectuals came by to condemn Ford for being 
ignorant. They claimed he really didn’t know much. So Ford 
invited them into his office and challenged them to ask him 
any question, and he would answer it. So this panel assembled 
around America’s most powerful industrialist and began to ask 
him questions. Ford listened to their questions and, when they were through, he simply reached for several phones on his desk 
and called in some of his bright assistants and asked them to 
give the panel the answers they sought. <br>One of the quotes credited to Ford goes: “Thinking is the 
hardest work there is. That is why so few people engage in it.”</p>

  <p class="P">Investors make money with money. They don’t have to work 
because their money is working for them.<br>I quadrant is the playground of the rich. Regardless of which 
quadrant people make their money in, if they hope someday to 
be rich, they ultimately must come to the I quadrant. It’s in the 
I quadrant that money becomes converted to wealth.</p>
