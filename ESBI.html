  <p class="P">This group of people could almost be the opposite of the S. 
Those who are true B’s like to surround themselves with smart 
people from all four categories: E, S, B, and I. Unlike the S, 
who doesn’t like to delegate work (because no one can do it 
better), the B likes to delegate. The true motto of a B is, “Why 
do it yourself when you can hire someone to do it for you, and 
they can do it better?”<br>Henry Ford fit this mold. As one popular story goes, a group 
of so-called intellectuals came by to condemn Ford for being 
ignorant. They claimed he really didn’t know much. So Ford 
invited them into his office and challenged them to ask him 
any question, and he would answer it. So this panel assembled 
around America’s most powerful industrialist and began to ask 
him questions. Ford listened to their questions and, when they were through, he simply reached for several phones on his desk 
and called in some of his bright assistants and asked them to 
give the panel the answers they sought. <br>One of the quotes credited to Ford goes: “Thinking is the 
hardest work there is. That is why so few people engage in it.”<br>One of the quotes credited to Ford goes: “Thinking is the
